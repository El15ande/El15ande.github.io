## 3. Architectural views

3.0 Issues in architecture documentation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What views or perspectives are useful when designing & documenting a system's architecture? [对于特定系统架构的合理视角]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What notations should be used for describing architectural models? [描述架构的合理表达]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Architects need to present multiple views of the architecture based on <u>different contexts</u>__

3.1 [The 4+1 view model (Krutchen 1995)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logical view: the key abstractions in the system as objects & classes [逻辑视图: 对象与类的抽象表达]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be possible to relate the system requirements to entities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Process view: shows how the system is composed of interacting processes at runtime [进程视图: 运行时多个进程之间的反应]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__It is useful for making judgments about non-functional system characteristics__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development view: shows how the software is decomposed for development (i.e. the breakdown of the software into components that are implemented by the developer(s)) [开发视图: 开发环境中软件的拆分]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__It is useful for software managers & programmers__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical view: shows the system hardware & how software components are distributed across the processors in the system [实体视图: 软件部署与硬件协作]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__It is useful for system engineers planning a system deployment__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Conceptual view (Hofmeister, Nord, and Soni 2000): an abstract view of the system that can be the basis of decomposing high-level requirements into more detailed specifications__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__It helps engineers make decisions about components that can be reused & represent a product line rather than a single system__

## 4. Architectural patterns

4.1 Usage of architecture pattern: presenting, sharing & reusing knowledge about software systems  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__A pattern should describe a system organisation that has been successful in previous systems__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__It should include information on <u>when it is (not) appropriate</u> to use that pattern & <u>details on the pattern's strengths & weaknesses</u>__

## 5. Application architectures

5.1 Application system are intended to <u>meet a business/orgnisational need</u> as it describes the structure & organisation of particular types of software systems [应用架构: 根据商业企业需求制定的软件架构]

5.2 Usage of application architecture model  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a starting point for the architectural design process: base the initial design on the generic architecture  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a design checklist: compare personalised design with generic model to ensure consistency  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a way of organising the work of the development team: identify stable structural features & assign work based on the structure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a means of assessing components for reuse: compare personalised reusable elements with generic structure to compare  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a vocabulary for talking about applications: aim at stakeholders
