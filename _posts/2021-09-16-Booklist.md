## Software Engineering Principles

- [Article] [Software Architecture and Design](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00262-6_3) (Richard N. Taylor (2019)): This is THE most comprehensive introduction I have ever read, it provides clear and complete definitions for those software architectural terms and concepts through a guided tour including:
    - The conceptual origination of software architecture: **DESIGN**.
    - An organised tour of software architecture evolution from 1970s.
    - Mature definitions for principal software architectural concepts: software architecture, architectural model, architectural style/pattern, architectural component/connector/configuration, etc.
