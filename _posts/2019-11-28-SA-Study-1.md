###### _Keyword: Software Architecture, Architectural Design Decisions, CS4099_

## 1. Overview

1.1 Design concern: understanding how a software system should be organised & designing the overall structure of that system [对软件系统管理的理解 & 系统总体结构的设计]  
- Output: <u>an architechtural model</u> that describes how the system is organised as <u>a set of communicating components</u> [输出: 由交流元件组成的架构模型]  
- __Early agile development process should focus on designing an overall system architecture__

1.2 Practical overlap between the processes of requirements engineering & architectural design  
- __Propose an abstract system architecture in requirement engineering: associate groups of system functions/features with large-scale components/sub-systems__

1.3 Design levels of abstraction  
- Architecture in the small: the architecture of individual programs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way that an individual program is decomposed into components  
- Architecture in the large: the architecture of complex enterprise systems  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems, programs & program components which may be distributed over different computers owned & managed by different companies

1.4 Importance of architecture: it affects the performance, robustness, distributability & maintainability of a system [架构重要性: 性能, 健壮性, 部署性, 可维护性]  
- __Explicit architecture documentation advantage:__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholder communication: a high-level presentation of the system that may be used as <u>a focus for discussion</u> by a range of different stakeholders [股东交流: 讨论核心]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System analysis: early architectural decisions have a profound effect on whether system meets critical requirements [系统分析: 需求满足度]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-scale reuse: <u>a compact, manageable description</u> of how a system is organised & how the components interoperate [大规模重用]

1.5 Usage of architectural model  
- Encourage discussions about the system design [加速系统设计讨论]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholders can relate to it & understand an abstract view of the system  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managers can start assigning people to plan the development of these systems  
- Document an architecture that has been designed [记录已设计的架构]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Produce a complete system model that shows the different components in a system, their interfaces & connections

## 2. Architectural design decisions

2.1 Design dependence  
- The <u>type of system</u> being developed [系统类型]  
- The <u>background & experience</u> of the system architect [架构师经验]  
- The <u>specific requirements</u> for the system [具体需求]  
- __Architectural design should be a series of decisions making rather than a sequence of activities__

2.3 Architectural pattern/style: a description of a system organisation that captures the essence of an architecture used in different systems [架构模式/风格: 同类型系统架构的管理方案]  
- __The choice of architectural style/structure should depend on the <u>non-functional requirements</u> of the system__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Performance: architecture should be designed to localise critical operations within a small number of components__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Security: layered structure should be used__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Safety: safety-related operations are co-located in a single component or small number of components__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Availability: architecture should be designed to includeredundant components so that it is possible to replace & update components without stopping the system__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Maintainability: architecture should be designed using fine-grain, self-contained components that readily be changed__

2.4 Compromise between small & large components  
- Large components improve performance [大元件: 提升性能]  
- Small components improve maintainability [小元件: 提升可维护性]  
- __Different compromises must be found based on different requirements, then use different architectural patterns/styles for separate parts of the system__

2.5 Evaluation of architectural design: how well the system meets its functional & non-functional requirements [系统对功能需求 & 非功能需求的满足]
