### Intro: when I really want to write some blogs...
This is my first CompSci blog & what I have done is just writing some markdown like taking notes on a piece of paper, the whole website is generated by Jekyll & hosted by GithubPage. This is really convenient for programmers (or even non-programmers) to write down their ideas, experiences (or bug complaints) in a few words, then a webpage blog, decorated with nice CSS & clustered in ideal structure, is already there.  
In this blog, I will share my experience about how to build a simple blogging website, with or without programming experience & totally without any costs.

### [GithubPage](https://pages.github.com/): free (probably) website hosting
There is a step-by-step tutorial from youtube for non-programmers: [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/FiOgz3nKpgk).  
And the Git command cheatsheet from Github: [Cheatsheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).  
A few tips:
1. The branching of the repoistory is actually not that necessary to do unless you want a really clustered repository structure or your OCD forces you to do that.  
2. For the pulling/pushing/merging activities, I recommand [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Atom-Github package](https://github.atom.io/). These GUIs are usually better than cmd lines especially when you have branched your repository or you want to merge branches.

### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): clustering blogs within a cup of coffee
Still, a step-by-step tutorial from official website: [Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/).  
And a youtube tutorial: [Tutorial2](https://youtu.be/fqFjuX4VZmU).  
The default jekyll folder created by `jekyll new <whereever>` has a documented but complex structure. What I recommand is to use `jekyll new --blank <whereever>` and this will initilise a blank jekyll project. In `_config.yml`, specify `theme: minima` to use the default neat css style.

### Retro: ...what I need is just markdown!
And of cource, it is a good habit for programmers to update their blogs in a period of time. I will try to write down 4-5 blogs per month in both English & Chinese (even in simple German for practice), this is really practical to improve my English writing & programming skills. The topics will cover CompSci(mostly), English writing & German studying experience(sometimes) and some daily blogs(rarely). I would be happy if someone comments or criticises my blogs (I promise this function will be deployed xd).
